## Purpose of This Toolkit
DeepLabCut’s napari interface suffers performance issues when the number of frames exceeds a few thousand, making manual frame extraction and track refinement tortuous tasks. This toolkit addresses these limitations by building a high-performance GUI with PySide6 and also introducing several features absent from the original DeepLabCut workflow, such as:

- Interactive 3D Skeleton Plotting (dlc_3D_plotter.py): Visualize synchronized 2D video feeds from multiple cameras alongside a live-rendered 3D skeleton, reconstructed from your 2D predictions and camera calibration data. This provides an immediate, intuitive quality check for your 3D tracking results.

- Automated 3D Track Correction (dlc_3D_plotter.py): The toolkit features an auto-3D-track-correct function that automatically detects and corrects identity swaps in projects with two animals. It analyzes the 3D trajectories to resolve ambiguities that are hard to fix by looking at 2D views alone.

- 2D Track Correction using idtracker.ai (dlc_track_refiner.py): A feature that allows leveraging the robust trajectory data from idtracker.ai to automatically cross-reference with DeepLabCut's pose estimation tracks, and curated integration code to ensure that the correct identity is picked.

### Prerequisites

- Install the DeepLabCut environment following the instructions on the [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut)

#### Required Folder Structure
The script expects a specific folder structure for videos and prediction files.
```
your_video_folder/
├── Camera1/
│   ├── 0.mp4
│   └── your_prediction_file.h5 (e.g., 'video_nameDLC_resnet50_modelname.h5')
├── Camera2/
│   ├── 0.mp4
│   └── your_prediction_file.h5
└── ...
```

**Inputs:**
- **DLC Config File (`config.yaml`):** A DeepLabCut project configuration file, which defines body parts, skeleton, and multi-animal settings.
- **Calibration File (`.mat`):** A MATLAB `.mat` file containing camera calibration parameters (e.g., `sync_dannce.mat`) ( produced in Label3D / DANNCE / SDANNCE workflow ). This file should contain camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
- **Video Folder:** A directory containing subfolders for each camera (e.g., `Camera1`, `Camera2`), where each subfolder contains the video file (`0.mp4`) and its corresponding DLC prediction `.h5` file.


### dlc_frame_extract.py

#### Functionality
A GUI application for manually extracting and marking frames from a video, serving as an orchestrator of workflow and data-io between DLC and track_refiner.

- **Video Loading & Display:** Supports common video formats (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`). Displays video frames with real-time updates and a progress slider.
- **DeepLabCut Integration:**
    - **Load DLC Predictions (`.h5`):** Overlays pose estimations (keypoints, bounding boxes, skeletons) directly onto video frames.
    - **Load DLC Config (`config.yaml`):** Utilizes the project configuration to correctly display body parts, skeleton connections, and individual animal identities (for multi-animal projects).
- **Interactive Frame Navigation:**
    - **Precise Control:** Navigate frame-by-frame or jump by 10 frames using dedicated buttons or keyboard shortcuts (←, →, Shift+←, Shift+→).
    - **Marking System:** Mark/unmark frames for later review or export. Marked frames are visually indicated on the progress slider.
    - **Jump to Marked Frames:** Quickly navigate to previous or next marked frames (↑, ↓ shortcuts).
    - **Autoplay:** Play/pause video playback for continuous review (Spacebar shortcut).
- **Prediction Visualization Control:**
    - **Adjust Confidence Cutoff:** Filter out low-confidence keypoints from prediction view.
- **Workspace Management & Export:**
    - **Save Workspace:** Save the current session's state (loaded video, prediction, config, marked frames) to a `.yaml` file for later resumption.
    - **Export to DLC:** Extracts all marked frames as `.png` images and generates a DLC-compatible `CollectedData_*.h5` file containing prediction data for these frames, ready for manual labeling in DeepLabCut.
    - **Export to Refiner:** Integrates with `dlc_track_refiner.py` by exporting the current video and prediction for further track refinement and keypoint correction.

#### Required Folder Structure
If the chosen video has previous label data in DLC, the script can work with the standard DLC project structure and read & mark the existing ( already labeled ) frames' idx in the progress bar in a different color.

```
your_dlc_project/
└── labeled-data/
    └── your_video_name/
        ├── img0000.png (existing frames)
        └── CollectedData_scorer.h5 (generated prediction data for labeling)
```

**Inputs:**
- **Video File:** The primary video file (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`) from which frames will be extracted and reviewed.
- **Prediction File (`.h5`):** (Optional) A DeepLabCut prediction `.h5` file. When loaded, pose estimations are overlaid on the video frames.
- **DLC Config File (`config.yaml`):** (Optional) A DeepLabCut project configuration file. Used to define body parts, skeleton connections, and multi-animal settings for accurate visualization of predictions.
- **Status File (`.yaml`):** (Optional) A previously saved workspace file from `dlc_frame_extract.py`. This file contains the video path, DLC config path, prediction path, and the list of marked frames, enabling resumption of a previous session.

**Outputs:**
- **Workspace Status File (`_extractor_status.yaml`):** A YAML file generated when "Save the Current Workspace" is selected (or Ctrl+S is pressed). It stores the paths to the loaded video, DLC config, prediction file, and the list of marked frames, enabling seamless session resumption.
- **Extracted Images:** When "Export to DLC" is used, marked frames are extracted as individual `.png` images and saved into the `labeled-data/your_video_name/` directory within your DLC project.
- **DLC-compatible HDF5:** When "Export to DLC" is used, a `CollectedData_*.h5` file is generated in the `labeled-data/your_video_name/` directory. This file contains the prediction data corresponding to the extracted frames, formatted for direct use in DeepLabCut's labeling interface.


### dlc_track_refiner.py

### dlc_dataset_augumenter.py

#### Functionality
A tool for augmenting DLC datasets by adjusting the tone (brightness, contrast, L/A/B channels) of images to match a reference image or a set of reference images. Features a GUI for manual adjustment and an auto-apply option for batch processing.

#### Required Folder Structure
The script expects the following structure for DLC labeled data and reference images:

```
your_dlc_project/
└── labeled-data/
    └── your_video_name/
        ├── img0000.png
        ├── img0001.png
        └── ...
        └── CollectedData_scorer.h5 (or .csv)

your_reference_folder/
└── frame_0000.png
└── frame_0001.png
└── ...
```

**Inputs:**
- **DLC Dataset Folder:** The `labeled-data` directory within a DLC project, containing subfolders for each video with labeled images (e.g., `imgXXXX.png`) and their corresponding `CollectedData_*.h5` or `.csv` files.
- **Reference Folder(s):** Directory/directories containing images whose tone you want to match. These images are used as a reference for tone adjustment.

**Outputs:**
- **Augmented Images:** A new folder named `your_video_name_augmented` will be created alongside the original `your_video_name` folder, containing the tone-adjusted images.


### dlc_obsolete_train_img_trimmer.py

#### Functionality
This script helps manage DLC training datasets by removing image files from a `labeled-data` directory that are no longer referenced in the corresponding `CollectedData_*.csv` file. This is useful in synergy with frame_extractor to remove the frames you extracted but don't feel like labeling later.

#### Required Folder Structure
The script operates directly on the `labeled-data` subfolder within a DLC project.

```
your_dlc_project/
└── labeled-data/
    └── your_video_name/
        ├── img0000.png
        ├── img0001.png
        └── ...
        └── CollectedData_scorer.csv
```

**Inputs:**
- **CSV File (`CollectedData_*.csv`):** The DeepLabCut CSV file that contains the list of currently labeled frames.
- **Project Directory:** The specific `labeled-data/your_video_name/` directory where the images and CSV file are located.

**Outputs:**
- **Cleaned Image Directory:** Obsolete `.png` image files (those not listed in the CSV) are deleted from the specified project directory.


### sleap_keypoint_fill.py

#### Functionality
This script is designed to fill in missing keypoints (NaN values) in SLEAP HDF5 files. It can duplicate and extend keypoints based on two main schemes:
- **Tail Extension:** Extends keypoints along a body vector (e.g., from head to tail) to fill in missing tail points. If a head-to-tail vector is not provided, it uses a random direction.
- **Limb Extension:** Extends keypoints from a source point using a small random vector, useful for filling in missing limb points.

**Inputs:**
- **SLEAP File (`.slp`):** The SLEAP HDF5 file containing the keypoint data to be processed.
- **`num_bodypart` (integer):** The total number of body parts defined in the SLEAP project.
- **`head_tail` (tuple, optional):** A tuple `(head_index, tail_index)` (1-based) used to define the body vector for tail extension.
- **`tail_scheme` (list of tuples, optional):** A list of `(source_index, new_index)` tuples (1-based) for tail keypoint duplication.
- **`limb_scheme` (list of tuples, optional):** A list of `(source_index, new_index)` tuples (1-based) for limb keypoint duplication.

**Outputs:**
- **Modified SLEAP File:** The input `.slp` file is modified in-place with the filled keypoint data.

### sleap_viewer.ipynb

A basic viewer to load and inspect data from a SLEAP HDF5 file (`.slp`).
- List the keys (datasets) available within the SLEAP HDF5 file.
- Access and print information about the `instances` dataset, including its fields and a few entries.
- Access and parse the `tracks_json` dataset to understand the mapping between internal track indices and user-defined track identifiers.
- Load the `points` dataset and map individual keypoint instances to their respective tracks and frames.
- Print an example of tracked points by identity and frame, showing how to retrieve specific keypoint coordinates.


### dlc_track_to_annot_prep.py
