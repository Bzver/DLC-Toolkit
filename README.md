### dlc_3D_skeleton_plotter.py

#### Functionality
A GUI application for visualizing 3D skeleton plots from multiple DeepLabCut predictions ( currently support 4 views only ), synchronized with corresponding 2D video feeds from multiple cameras. Key features include:
- **Multi-camera 2D video display:** Shows synchronized video frames from up to 4 cameras.
- **3D skeleton visualization:** Plots the 3D reconstructed skeleton based on 2D predictions and camera calibrations.
- **Track refinement integration:** Can launch the `DLC_Track_Refiner` tool for selected camera views to correct 2D tracks.

#### Required Folder Structure
The script expects a specific folder structure for videos and prediction files, especially for multi-camera setups.
```
your_video_folder/
├── Camera1/
│   ├── 0.mp4
│   └── your_prediction_file.h5 (e.g., 'video_nameDLC_resnet50_modelname.h5')
├── Camera2/
│   ├── 0.mp4
│   └── your_prediction_file.h5
└── ...
```

**Inputs:**
- **DLC Config File (`config.yaml`):** A DeepLabCut project configuration file, which defines body parts, skeleton, and multi-animal settings.
- **Calibration File (`.mat`):** A MATLAB `.mat` file containing camera calibration parameters (e.g., `sync_dannce.mat`) ( produced in Label3D / DANNCE / SDANNCE workflow ). This file should contain camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
- **Video Folder:** A directory containing subfolders for each camera (e.g., `Camera1`, `Camera2`), where each subfolder contains the video file (`0.mp4`) and its corresponding DLC prediction `.h5` file.

### dlc_dataset_augumenter.py

#### Functionality
A tool for augmenting DLC datasets by adjusting the tone (brightness, contrast, L/A/B channels) of images to match a reference image or a set of reference images. Features an interactive GUI for manual adjustment and an auto-apply option for batch processing. Useful for improving model robustness when training data comes from different lighting conditions or camera settings.

#### Required Folder Structure
The script expects the following structure for DLC labeled data and reference images:

```
your_dlc_project/
└── labeled-data/
    └── your_video_name/
        ├── img0000.png
        ├── img0001.png
        └── ...
        └── CollectedData_YourName.h5 (or .csv)

your_reference_folder/
└── frame_0000.png
└── frame_0001.png
└── ...
```

**Inputs:**
- **DLC Dataset Folder:** The `labeled-data` directory within a DLC project, containing subfolders for each video with labeled images (e.g., `imgXXXX.png`) and their corresponding `CollectedData_*.h5` or `.csv` files.
- **Reference Folder(s):** Directory/directories containing images whose tone you want to match. These images are used as a reference for tone adjustment.

**Outputs:**
- **Augmented Images:** A new folder named `your_video_name_augmented` will be created alongside the original `your_video_name` folder, containing the tone-adjusted images.

### dlc_h5_to_csv.py

A simple utility script borrowed from DLC repo that converts DLC prediction `.h5` files to `.csv` format leveraging the `analyze_videos_converth5_to_csv` function within deeplabcut.

### dlc_manual_frame_extract.py

#### Functionality
A GUI application for manually extracting and marking frames from a video, primarily for DLC labeling purposes. It allows users to:
- **Load videos and DLC predictions:** Visualize predictions overlaid on video frames.
- **Mark/unmark frames:** Easily select frames for further labeling or analysis.
- **Navigate frames:** Step through frames, jump to marked frames, and autoplays through the frames.
- **Adjust confidence cutoff:** Filter out low-confidence keypoints from prediction view.
- **Save marked frames:** Export a list of marked frames to a YAML file.
- **Save to DLC format:** Extract marked frames as images and convert prediction data to a DLC-compatible HDF5 format for labeling.

#### Required Folder Structure
For saving marked frames and predictions in a DLC-compatible format, the script interacts with the standard DLC project structure.

```
your_dlc_project/
└── labeled-data/
    └── your_video_name/
        ├── img0000.png (extracted frames)
        └── CollectedData_YourName.h5 (generated prediction data for labeling)
```

**Inputs:**
- **Video File:** The video file from which frames will be extracted.
- **Prediction File (`.h5`):** (Optional) A DeepLabCut prediction `.h5` file to overlay pose estimations on the video.
- **DLC Config File (`config.yaml`):** (Optional) A DeepLabCut project configuration file to display keypoint labels and skeletons.
- **Marked Frames File (`.yaml`):** (Optional) A YAML file containing a previously saved list of marked frames.

**Outputs:**
- **Marked Frames File (`_frame_list.yaml`):** A YAML file containing the list of manually marked frame indices. ( When using Ctrl+S for manual saving)
- **Extracted Images:** If "Save to DLC" is used, selected frames are extracted as `.png` images into the `labeled-data/your_video_name/` directory within the specified DLC project.
- **DLC-compatible HDF5:** If "Save to DLC" is used, a `CollectedData_*.h5` file is generated in the `labeled-data/your_video_name/` directory, containing the prediction data for the extracted frames, ready for DLC labeling.

### dlc_obsolete_train_img_trimmer.py

#### Functionality
This script helps manage DLC training datasets by removing image files from a `labeled-data` directory that are no longer referenced in the corresponding `CollectedData_*.csv` file. This is useful in synergy with frame_extractor to remove the frames you extracted but don't feel like labeling later.

#### Required Folder Structure
The script operates directly on the `labeled-data` subfolder within a DLC project.

```
your_dlc_project/
└── labeled-data/
    └── your_video_name/
        ├── img0000.png
        ├── img0001.png
        └── ...
        └── CollectedData_YourName.csv
```

**Inputs:**
- **CSV File (`CollectedData_*.csv`):** The DeepLabCut CSV file that contains the list of currently labeled frames.
- **Project Directory:** The specific `labeled-data/your_video_name/` directory where the images and CSV file are located.

**Outputs:**
- **Cleaned Image Directory:** Obsolete `.png` image files (those not listed in the CSV) are deleted from the specified project directory.

### dlc_track_refiner.py

#### Functionality
A comprehensive GUI tool for refining DLC tracking data. It allows users to manually correct, interpolate, delete, and swap tracks for individual instances (animals) across video frames. Key features include:
- **Interactive video and prediction display:** Overlays DLC predictions (keypoints, skeletons, bounding boxes) on video frames.
- **Manual keypoint and bounding box editing:** Users can drag and drop keypoints and entire bounding boxes to correct mislabeled or inaccurate predictions.
- **Track manipulation:**
    - **Swap Track:** Exchange the identities of two instances for a single frame or a batch of frames.
    - **Delete Track:** Remove an instance's track data for a single frame or a batch of frames.
    - **Interpolate Track:** Fill in missing or inaccurate track data between two valid points.
    - **Retroactive Fill:** Propagate the last valid keypoint position forward to fill gaps.
- **Advanced refinement options:**
    - **Purge Instance by Confidence:** Delete all tracks below a set confidence threshold.
    - **Interpolate All Frames for One Instance:** Apply interpolation across all frames for a selected instance.
    - **Remove All Prediction Inside Area:** Define a region of interest to remove all predictions within it.
    - **Segmental Auto Correct:** (Experimental) Automated correction for segments of tracks in a specific setup.
- **Undo/Redo functionality:** Allows users to revert or reapply changes.
- **Save refined predictions:** Save the modified prediction data back to a new `.h5` file.

**Inputs:**
- **Video File:** The video file to be refined.
- **DLC Config File (`config.yaml`):** A DeepLabCut project configuration file, essential for defining body parts, skeleton, and multi-animal settings.
- **Prediction File (`.h5`):** The DeepLabCut prediction `.h5` file containing the tracking data to be refined.

**Outputs:**
- **Refined Prediction File (`_refiner_modified_*.h5`):** A new `.h5` file is generated with the refined tracking data. The original prediction file is preserved.

### sleap_keypoint_fill.py

#### Functionality
This script is designed to fill in missing keypoints (NaN values) in SLEAP HDF5 files. It can duplicate and extend keypoints based on two main schemes:
- **Tail Extension:** Extends keypoints along a body vector (e.g., from head to tail) to fill in missing tail points. If a head-to-tail vector is not provided, it uses a random direction.
- **Limb Extension:** Extends keypoints from a source point using a small random vector, useful for filling in missing limb points.

This is particularly useful for pre-processing SLEAP data to ensure complete keypoint sets.

**Inputs:**
- **SLEAP File (`.slp`):** The SLEAP HDF5 file containing the keypoint data to be processed.
- **`num_bodypart` (integer):** The total number of body parts defined in the SLEAP project.
- **`head_tail` (tuple, optional):** A tuple `(head_index, tail_index)` (1-based) used to define the body vector for tail extension.
- **`tail_scheme` (list of tuples, optional):** A list of `(source_index, new_index)` tuples (1-based) for tail keypoint duplication.
- **`limb_scheme` (list of tuples, optional):** A list of `(source_index, new_index)` tuples (1-based) for limb keypoint duplication.

**Outputs:**
- **Modified SLEAP File:** The input `.slp` file is modified in-place with the filled keypoint data.

### sleap_viewer.ipynb

A basic viewer to load and inspect data from a SLEAP HDF5 file (`.slp`). 
- List the keys (datasets) available within the SLEAP HDF5 file.
- Access and print information about the `instances` dataset, including its fields and a few entries.
- Access and parse the `tracks_json` dataset to understand the mapping between internal track indices and user-defined track identifiers.
- Load the `points` dataset and map individual keypoint instances to their respective tracks and frames.
- Print an example of tracked points by identity and frame, showing how to retrieve specific keypoint coordinates.
